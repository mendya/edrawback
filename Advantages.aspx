    <h3>THE ADVANTAGES OF USING eDRAWBACK AS YOUR DUTY DRAWBACK SPECIALIST</h3>


    The laws involved in properly applying for a duty drawback are cumbersome and complicated. For a company to try to do its own drawback filing is overwhelming and exhausting. It is likely that the company will either give up or have to hire additional staff just to deal with its duty drawbacks. It is probably for this reason that most companies don’t even bother trying to recover their rightful refund. We at eDRAWBACK understand this frustration and are here to solve this problem. Using technology designed by importers, eDRAWBACK simplifies the process and takes on the burden of getting your money back. There is no longer any reason to hire additional staff or get frustrated with the lengthy paper work, eDRAWBACK is ready to do it all for you.<br />
