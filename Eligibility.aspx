    <h3>Eligibility</h3>
                        Most companies are unaware of their legal rights to request a duty drawback. There are many different situations in which one could be eligible for a duty drawback. Below are the more common scenarios. By law, the drawback must be claimed within three years of importation of the merchandise. As each day passes, more merchandise passes the three year expiration date. It is, therefore, essential to file the claim promptly. If you think your company is qualified for these rebates please <a href="mailto:info@edrawbacks.com?Subject=Please%20send%20me%20more%20information%20about%20Edrawbacks." target="_top">contact us</a> today.
