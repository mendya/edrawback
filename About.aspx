    <h3>WHAT IS A DUTY DRAWBACK?</h3>
    The legal definition for a duty drawback, as found in section 191.2(i) of the U.S. customs regulations is “the refund or remission, in whole or in part, of a customs duty, fee or internal revenue tax which was imposed on imported merchandise under federal law because of its importation, and the refund of internal revenue taxes paid on domestic alcohol as prescribed in 19 U.S.C. 1313(d)”.
    <br />
    Duty drawbacks are one of the oldest laws in the United States. Passed in 1789, duty drawbacks allow importers under certain conditions to receive a refund of taxes and duties paid upon importing merchandise.
When imported merchandise is later exported within three years of importation, a duty drawback may be accessible. The rationale behind this law  is to encourage American exports and products overseas as well as to aid American labor and manufacturing.
    <br />
    On average, it’s estimated that up to 85% of legally available drawbacks aren’t claimed and are therefore forfeited to the government. Make sure that your company is not adding to this high statistic by contacting eDRAWBACK today.
